## Features

* Replaces LinkedIn’s generic apply text with **precise apply & view counts**.
* Works directly on job posting pages.
* Updates automatically as you browse.
* Lightweight and fast, with caching to reduce extra requests.

## Installation

1. **Install from Chrome Web Store**: [Chrome Web Store Link](PLACEHOLDER_CHROME_STORE_LINK)
2. Open any LinkedIn job posting.
3. See the real-time apply & view numbers instantly.

## How It Works

The extension detects the apply count element in the job posting header and replaces it with live numbers fetched from LinkedIn’s job posting API.
It works in all languages and avoids relying on text matching, so it’s fully localization-friendly.

## Privacy

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
